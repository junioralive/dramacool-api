# dramacool-api

A REST API for Dramacool, hosted just for you! Unlimited calls, no strings attached—we're like that cool friend who lets you crash on their couch and eat their snacks. We don’t care about limits, just binge, scrape, and enjoy. Drama on demand, no drama from us!

We’ve got your drama cravings covered—Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese, Thai, Chinese, you name it! Our API serves up metadata like a pro and even throws in direct streaming links (m3u8 or embedded, because we’re flexible like that). And yes, we support English subtitles, because what’s drama without understanding the *drama*? Unlimited drama, zero judgment—go ahead, binge responsibly (or not)!

Unlock the drama at [https://api.xyrastream.live/v1/dramacool/doc](https://api.xyrastream.live/v1/dramacool/doc)—your backstage pass to endless streaming chaos!

>How to get access? Oh, it’s nothing fancy—just join our Discord server! A free API key is lounging there, waiting just for you. Seriously, no hoops, no fine print, just good ol’ drama vibes. Grab it, and let the binge begin!
